# Italian Teacher Multi-Agent Framework - Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEW FOCUS**: Start Simple, Validate Early, Scale Smart

**IMMEDIATE GOAL**: Build one working Italian conversation agent that people actually use and find valuable.

**KEY INSIGHT**: Focus on getting 50+ active users with a simple single-agent system before building complex multi-agent coordination.

## Project Overview
A sophisticated multi-agent AI system for personalized Italian language learning, featuring distinct AI personalities that collaborate to provide immersive, contextual language education.

**Current Phase**: MVP Single Agent (Weeks 1-6) - Focus on Marco only
