## 🔍 Detailed Scorer Descriptions

### 1. JSON Scorer (15 points)

**File**: `scorers/json_scorer.py`

#### Validation Rules

```python
# Required fields (6 pts)
✓ type, question, correct_answer must be present

# Type matching (3 pts with MASSIVE penalties)
✓ Type MUST match request
❌ Type mismatch: -30 points (drops score from ~86 to ~56!)

# Type-specific validation (6 pts)
✓ multiple_choice: Must have options array with 3-5 unique items
❌ multiple_choice with options=null: -20 points
✓ fill_in_blank/translation: Must have options=null
❌ fill_in_blank with options array: -10 points
```

#### Critical Features

✓ Proper punctuation patterns
```

#### Critical Features

- **spaCy POS tagging** - Analyzes part-of-speech distribution

---

### 6. Grammar Scorer (10 points)

**File**: `scorers/grammar_scorer.py`
**Purpose**: Validates grammar focus matches request

#### Validation Rules - **100% spaCy Morphology** ✨

```python
# PROFESSIONAL APPROACH: Zero hardcoded word lists!

# Maps grammar focus to spaCy morphological features
grammar_features = {
    "past_tense": {
        "morph_type": "Tense",
        "expected_values": ["Past", "Imp"]  # Past + Imperfect
    },
    "conditional": {
        "morph_type": "Mood",
        "expected_values": ["Cnd"]
    },
    "subjunctive": {
        "morph_type": "Mood",
        "expected_values": ["Sub"]
    },
    "pronouns": {
        "morph_type": "PronType",
        "expected_values": ["Prs", "Dem", "Ind"]  # Personal, Demonstrative, Indefinite
    }
    # ... more features
}

# Validation:
1. Extract tokens based on morph_type (VERB/AUX for tenses, PRON for pronouns)
2. Check spaCy morphology: token.morph.get("Tense"), token.morph.get("Mood"), etc.
3. Count matches vs total tokens
4. Linear penalty: match_ratio * 10.0 points
```

#### Critical Features

- **ZERO hardcoded lists** - No "ho/hai/ha/abbiamo" patterns!
- **Pure spaCy morphology** - Uses Tense, Mood, PronType features
- **Unified validation** - Single `_check_morphology()` method for all grammar types
- **Professional NLP** - Relies on spaCy's linguistic models, not regex

**Example**:
```python
# OLD (REMOVED): Hardcoded list matching
if answer in ["ho", "hai", "ha", "abbiamo", "avete", "hanno"]:  # ❌ NOT PROFESSIONAL

# NEW: spaCy morphology
for token in doc:
    if "Past" in token.morph.get("Tense"):  # ✅ PROFESSIONAL
        matching_tokens += 1
```

---

### 7. Topic Scorer (10 points)

**File**: `scorers/topic_scorer.py`
**Purpose**: Validates semantic relevance to requested topic

#### Validation Rules

```python
# Uses sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2

# 1. Extract Italian text from exercise
# 2. Compute embedding similarity between text and topic
# 3. Score based on cosine similarity:
   ✓ 0.8-1.0: Perfect relevance (10 pts)
   ✓ 0.6-0.8: Good relevance (7-10 pts)
   ✓ 0.4-0.6: Moderate relevance (4-7 pts)
   ✓ 0.0-0.4: Low relevance (0-4 pts)
```

#### Critical Features

- **Semantic embeddings** - Not keyword matching!

- **GPU-accelerated** - Can run on CUDA for speed

---

### 8. Coherence Scorer (10 points)

**File**: `scorers/coherence_scorer.py`
**Purpose**: Validates logical sense and semantic coherence

#### Validation Rules

```python
# Two-tier validation:

# Tier 1: spaCy linguistic analysis (always runs)
✓ No excessive word repetition (3+ times)
✓ Balanced sentence structure
✓ Proper verb usage
✓ Logical word order

# Tier 2: OpenAI validation (optional, for low scores)
✓ If spaCy score < 7: Ask GPT-4o-mini "Does this make sense?"
✓ Catch nonsensical exercises missed by rules
✓ Professional-grade quality assurance
```

#### Critical Features

- **Hybrid validation** - Fast spaCy + careful OpenAI

## 🔄 Integration: How Scorers Work Together

### Reward Function Flow

```python
# reward_function_modular.py

class ExerciseRewardFunction:
    def score(self, exercise, request):
        # 1. Score each component
        json_score = scorers["json"].score(exercise, request)         # 15 pts
        quality_score = scorers["quality"].score(exercise, request)    # 20 pts
        linguistic_score = scorers["linguistic"].score(exercise, request)  # 25 pts
        cefr_score = scorers["cefr"].score(exercise, request)         # 20 pts
        fluency_score = scorers["fluency"].score(exercise, request)   # 10 pts
        grammar_score = scorers["grammar"].score(exercise, request)   # 10 pts
        topic_score = scorers["topic"].score(exercise, request)       # 10 pts
        coherence_score = scorers["coherence"].score(exercise, request)  # 10 pts

        # 2. Sum to raw total (120 points)
        raw_total = sum([json_score, quality_score, linguistic_score, ...])

        # 3. Normalize to 100
        final_score = (raw_total / 120) * 100

        # 4. Return score + detailed breakdown
        return final_score, RewardBreakdown(
            json_validity=json_score,
            exercise_quality=quality_score,
            linguistic_quality=linguistic_score,
            cefr_alignment=cefr_score,
            fluency=fluency_score,
            grammar_correctness=grammar_score,
            topic_adherence=topic_score,
            coherence=coherence_score,
            total=final_score,
            errors=[...all errors from all scorers...]
        )
```

### Multi-Reward Async Wrapper

**File**: `multi_reward_async.py`

```python
# Wraps ExerciseRewardFunction for GRPO training

class AsyncMultiReward:
    def __call__(self, completions, requests):
        # 1. Parse JSON from model completions
        exercises = [self._parse_exercises(completion) for completion in completions]

        # 2. Score each exercise
        scores = []
        for exercises_list, request in zip(exercises, requests):
            for exercise in exercises_list:
                score, _ = reward_fn.score(exercise, request)
                scores.append(score / 100.0)  # Normalize to 0-1 for GRPO

        # 3. Return tensor for GRPO
        return torch.tensor(scores)
```

#### Critical Features

- **JSON parser with malformation handling** - Strips repetitive `]\n\n]` patterns

## 🔧 Maintenance & Extension

### Adding a New Scorer

```python
# 1. Create scorer class in scorers/
class NewScorer(BaseScorer):
    def score(self, exercise, request):
        # Your validation logic
        return score, errors

    @property
    def max_score(self):
        return 15.0  # Your max points

# 2. Add to scorers/__init__.py
from .new_scorer import NewScorer
__all__ = [..., "NewScorer"]

# 3. Integrate in reward_function_modular.py
self.scorers["new"] = NewScorer(nlp=self.nlp)

# 4. Update RewardBreakdown
@dataclass
class RewardBreakdown:
    new_score: float  # 0-15
    # ... other scores
    total: float  # Increase total max (120 → 135)

# 5. Update scoring logic
new_score, new_errors = self.scorers["new"].score(exercise, request)
raw_total = (... + new_score)
total = (raw_total / 135) * 100  # Update normalization
```

### Adjusting Weights

```python
# To change scorer importance, modify max_score:

# Example: Make grammar focus more important
# In grammar_scorer.py:
@property
def max_score(self):
    return 15.0  # Increased from 10.0

# Then update total in reward_function_modular.py:
total = (raw_total / 125) * 100  # 120 + 5 extra = 125
```
