    - Context sufficiency (Fill-in-blank): Must have explicit clues (10 pts) [BLOCKING]
    - Structure validity (Translation): Must have distinct English question and Italian answer (10 pts) [BLOCKING]
    - No redundancy: Answer must not appear in question (8 pts) [BLOCKING]
    - Answer quality: Answer must not be empty/too short (2 pts)
