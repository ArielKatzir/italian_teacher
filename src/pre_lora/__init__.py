Pre-LoRA implementations for Italian Teacher

This package contains temporary implementations that will be replaced
when LoRA fine-tuning is implemented. These modules provide:

1. Rule-based Italian error correction
2. Comprehensive error pattern databases
3. Training data generation for future LoRA models

All modules here import core types from src.core but implement
pre-LoRA logic that can be easily swapped out later.
